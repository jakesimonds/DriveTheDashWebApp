## plan



* v0.1: Proof of Concept
  * App has login, a database instance, users can create a session & drive robot
  * Robot can be controlled end-to-end consistently (ie it can be done in ~10 minutes consistently)
* v0.2: Prototype
  * Added functionality: 
    - developer portal fleshed out, has a few working queryable endpoints
    - user sessions are being logged in database, scores are calculated, result is seen on 'high score' page
    - Robot 'Server' (code running on linux machine) has been cleaned up & everything possible to move over to web app has been moved over
* v0.3: Final project
  * Webcam allows users to see robot being driven
  * Documentation complete, Developer Portal complete
* v0.3.5 Things I will do if time allows or (more likely) beyond 5610
  * 'Server' is ported to RaspberryPi5 & Pi physically mounted on robot 
  *
