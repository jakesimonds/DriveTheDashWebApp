# proposal guidelines

* Submit a proposal for your team's final project in this repo as both a PDF and a markdown file.
* The PDF should be no more than two pages of text (not including figures). This is a proposal requirement only. You will have an opportunity to provide more extensive documentation at the end of the project. 
* The markdown file should contain exactly the same content as the PDF.
* The proposal will be discussed with the instructor(s) during the first class after the due date.
* The 15-minute (maximum) discussion will be an opportunity to assess project scope and feasibility with your instructor(s).
* Any progress on your project repository will be reviewed and discussed at that time.
* Your project proposal and the follow-on discussion will be judged in their ability to meet the assessment criterion for the project.

## Assessment criterion

The Final Project for the course provides an opportunity to apply and 
synthesize the concepts and aspects learned throughout the semester in a 
single, large-scale effort that can serve as both a learning-objective
verification and a portfolio-building example.

## Proposal requirements

The proposal should include the following section headings -- see additional guidance below for each section.

* Team
  * Team members and team lead
  * Team lead's github-classroom repo will be used for the project
* Project goal
* User stories
* UI design
* Architecture and technical requirements

## Project goal

Short description of project goal. This should be concise.

Here are examples drawn from our in-class exercises:

* Breakout game: A Breakout game written entirely in pure JavaScript and rendered on HTML canvas element.
* ToDo list: A React app that allows users to add, edit, and 
  delete tasks they want to work on, and also mark tasks as complete without deleting them. The bells and 
  whistles that our team will include.
* Blog: A full-stack blog application that allows users to register, log in, create posts, and edit or delete 
  their own posts.

## User stories

An example of user stories appears in the React app that we discussed in class...

* [User story](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_todo_list_beginning#our_apps_user_stories)

If you expect multiple users with different roles, then you should describe multiple users' stories.

## UI design

An example of UI design appears in the mdn browser-extension section at mdn. That example is cited here to give you an
idea of how you might describe your own proposed UI. You have flexibility in how you'd like to approach this
proposal requirement. You may use UML, screen shots from a design tool such as figma.com, or some other approach that provides
comparable information.

* [Browser extension UI design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface) -- mdn

## Architecture and technical requirements

While you are expected to synthesize concepts and technologies covered in class, you have quite a bit of flexibility here. Learning goals for the course include the ability to find, learn, and use additional tools. You may therefore replace something that might have been a requirement from the class materials with something worthy of the learning goals. That means you should be able to answer relevant questions including (but not limited to)...

* Are you proposing a full-stack application?  If not, why not and what will you do instead?
* How will your app use data, including information about and/or provided by your users?
* Will your app have authentication? If not, then how will you address security?
* Will your app have a REST API? If not, why not and what will you do instead?
* Will your app consume data from a web-accessible API? If not, why not and what will you do instead?
* What technologies will you use, and why?

## Additional requirements

These additional requirements apply to both the proposal and final project submission as appropriate.

* **Acknowledgment:** Regardless of the path you choose for your project,
  you must clearly reference the resources that you use to create your app.
  That may include resources discussed in class, mdn, books, 
  well-established open source projects, other reputable sources, 
  or anything else that you find helpful. Be complete and be concise.
  Chatbots, random blogs, social media and LLMs that do not cite their sources, submit to peer review or undergo editorial oversight are not sufficient.
  Acknowledgment and attribution are important elements of open source software development. 
  "Copy and paste" that violates software licenses can have 
  serious consequences that extend well beyond plagiarism, so be careful.
  Insufficient acknowledgment will negatively impact the final grade.
* **Reproducibility:** In the README.md for your app repo, you must provide all instructions necessary for your TAs and instructor to 
create the dev environment (as we did in class) to run your app.
* **Deployment:** It should be easy for your instructors to run your app locally on development servers, 
but there is **no** requirement to deploy your app on the public internet. If you plan to deploy your app, then you must add 
  a privacy policy statement in your final project submission. For example, see Berkeley's guidance on how to write an effective website
  [privacy statement](https://security.berkeley.edu/how-write-effective-website-privacy-statement).

## Project management

* Recall that students are expected to work in teams of 3. Students may work individually or on smaller teams with permission of an instructor.
* **Work plan:** Although not part of the proposal submission, a project-management plan should be part of the repo that is discussed 
  with instructors along with the proposal.
  The team lead's repo should include that work plan as a separate markdown file in the proposal subdirectory. The plan should detail roles and responsibilities of the entire team, with milestones and a timeline.
  Instructors may adjust the final project grades for team projects based upon the documented effort. 
  For example, the student who developed and integrated project parts may receive a higher 
  score than a student who developed only a minor component. 
  A students who completed 65% of the development effort may receive a higher grade than one who only completed 35% of the effort. 
  Be specific on task assignments and
  project-management strategies so that appropriate credit may be given where appropriate.
